## High level plan

- Create a generic API system following API standards
- Create a very easy way for a user(developer) to set up models
- Create a url generator for complex endpoints and option to copy the generated URL or create a shortened version
- Create a generic CMS solution with option for user to customize based on needs
- Create a mobile app with the basic model generation features so a user can set up an API system on the go
